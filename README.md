# Predicting Customer Behavior in Online Shopping

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer behavior in online shopping using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various features related to customer activities and transactions in an online shopping platform. By analyzing this data, we can develop models to predict whether a customer is likely to make a purchase or not, which can help businesses in targeted marketing and improving their services.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is provided in the attached file named "online_shopping_dataset.csv". It includes the following columns:
- Customer ID
- Product category browsed
- Whether a purchase was made (target variable)
- And more...

## Methods
We will employ various machine learning algorithms to build predictive models, including but not limited to:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting

## Implementation
The project is implemented in a Google Colab notebook for easy access and collaboration. All the code and documentation are provided in the notebook. The notebook includes the following sections:
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building
5. Model Evaluation
6. Conclusion and Future Work

## Getting Started
To run this project:
1. Download the dataset file "online_shopping_dataset.csv" from the GitHub repository.
2. Open the Google Colab notebook provided in the repository.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code cells sequentially.

## Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Make sure these libraries are installed in your Python environment before running the notebook.

## Conclusion
Predicting customer behavior in online shopping is a crucial task for businesses to enhance user experience and increase sales. Through this project, we demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning in addressing this problem. Further improvements and optimizations can be explored for better predictive performance.
